# CxVision

CxVision contains extensions for the VIsion framework that provide Combine `Publisher`s for working with asyncronous flows.
Rather than putting all of your logic in something like a VNRecognizeTextRequest closure, CxVision provides publishers that enable a
more declaritive style of handling your data flow and error handling rather than placing all of the work in the callback.
